            A work at home parent is an entrepreneur who works from home and integrates parenting into his or her business activities. 
            They are sometimes referred to as a WAHM (work at home mom) or a WAHD (work at home dad).<br><br>

            Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating commuting, or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for childcare outside the home,[1] others integrate child rearing into their work day and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.
