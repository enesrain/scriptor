            A graphic designer is a professional within the graphic design and
            graphic arts industry who assembles together images, typography, or
            motion graphics to create a piece of design. A graphic designer
            creates the graphics primarily for published, printed or electronic
            media, such as brochures (sometimes) and advertising. They are also
            sometimes responsible for typesetting, illustration, user
            interfaces, web design, or take a teaching position. A core
            responsibility of the designer’s job is to present information in a
            way that is both accessible and memorable.

            The Apple Watch is a smartwatch developed by Apple Inc. It
            incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities as
            well as integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.
            The device is available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple
            Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition. The Watch is
            distinguished by different combinations of cases and first or third
            party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly
            connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as
            calling and texting. It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later
            models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Bluetooth or
            Wi-Fi.

            In the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and United
            Kingdom, hiking refers to walking outdoors on a trail, or off trail,
            for recreational purposes. A day hike refers to a hike that can be
            completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word
            walking is also used, as well as rambling, while walking in
            mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England,
            Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking
            describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for
            both features there.
